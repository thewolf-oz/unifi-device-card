# Changelog

## [v0.2.1] - 2026-04-06

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **Port link detection via PoE power and RX/TX traffic** — Ports without a usable link entity or speed sensor fallback could still be shown as offline even though they were actively powering a PoE device or carrying traffic. Link detection now also treats `poe_power > 0` and active RX/TX throughput as valid link signals.

- **False online state on WAN/SFP special ports** — Special WAN/SFP slots could report a false online state from negotiated speed alone, even when no real traffic was present. If RX/TX traffic entities are available, live traffic is now used as the decisive signal for these ports.

- **Disabled entities no longer create broken controls** — Home Assistant can expose entities disabled by the integration that have no live state in `hass.states`. These are now filtered out before rendering so missing or non-functional port/PoE buttons are no longer shown.

- **WAN/SFP slots on UDM Pro and UDM SE** — Special WAN/SFP slots were not correctly resolved to their underlying discovered ports and therefore appeared empty or offline. Special slots now resolve by real port number and are excluded from the normal numbered grid to prevent duplicate rendering.

- **Renamed port entities now resolve correctly** — Renamed port entities without `_port_N` in the `entity_id` could no longer be mapped back to a physical port. Missing `unique_id` values are now fetched on demand and used as an additional fallback for port number extraction.

- **RX/TX throughput formatting** — Numeric throughput values are now rounded to two decimal places for cleaner display.

### ✨ New Devices

- **US 16 PoE 150W (`US16P150`)** — Added dedicated model handling with a dual-row layout and SFP uplink slots.

- **USW Pro 24 (`US24PRO2`)** — Added dedicated model handling with a six-grid layout and SFP+ uplink slots.

---

### 🎨 UI / Visual Changes

- **USW 24 PoE layout** — Updated from `dual-row` (2 × 12) to `six-grid` (4 × 6) for a more accurate front panel representation.

- **Optional card background color** — The outer card background now defaults to the Home Assistant card background and can optionally be overridden via `background_color` in the card configuration/editor.

## [v0.2.0] - 2026-04-06

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **Port discovery for renamed entities** — Home Assistant 2022.6+ no longer includes `unique_id` in the WebSocket entity registry list. Port numbers for renamed port entities could no longer be resolved, causing ports to appear without data. Missing `unique_id`s are now fetched on demand via `config/entity_registry/get` and patched in before port discovery runs.

- **UDM Pro port count & special slots** — Port count corrected from 8 to 11. WAN/SFP special slots now carry explicit port numbers (9, 10, 11) so they are resolved from real port data instead of relying on fragile key matching. Slot keys updated to `wan`, `sfp_1`, `sfp_2`.

- **Special port online detection** — WAN and SFP uplink ports no longer show a false "online" state caused by stale link-speed sensors. If RX/TX bandwidth sensors are available, live traffic is used to determine whether the port is actually carrying data.

- **PoE status for ports without a switch entity** — Ports that expose only a `poe_power` sensor (no toggle switch) now correctly show PoE power consumption. The PoE toggle button is hidden for these ports instead of appearing non-functional.

- **Special slot port-label in detail panel** — Custom port labels (`port_label`) are now also shown for special slots (WAN, SFP) in the detail panel, not only for numbered ports.

- **Sensor value formatting** — Numeric sensor states are now rounded to two decimal places (e.g. `1.23 Mbit/s` instead of `1.2345678 Mbit/s`).

- **Special ports excluded from numbered port grid** — Ports that are mapped to a special slot by port number are now correctly excluded from the regular port grid to avoid duplicate rendering.

### ✨ New Devices

- **US 16 PoE 150W (`US16P150`)** — 16 RJ45 PoE ports in a dual-row layout (2 × 8) plus two dedicated SFP uplink slots (ports 17 & 18). Model aliases `US16P` and `US16P150` are both recognized.

- **USW Pro 24 (`US24PRO2`)** — 24 RJ45 ports in a six-grid layout (4 × 6) plus two dedicated SFP+ uplink slots (ports 25 & 26). Recognized via model strings `US24PRO2`, `US24PRO`, and `USWPRO24`.

---

### 🎨 UI / Visual Changes

- **USW 24 PoE layout** — Switched from a `dual-row` (2 × 12) layout to `six-grid` (4 × 6) for a more accurate representation of the physical front panel.

- **Port LED — PoE indicator** — The separate orange PoE LED has been replaced with a subtle ring highlight (`box-shadow`) on the link LED when PoE is active. This matches the visual style of real UniFi switches where a single LED indicates both link and PoE state through color and brightness rather than a second indicator. The PoE state remains fully visible in the port detail panel.

- **Port LED alignment** — LEDs are now centered within the port button instead of being spread to the edges.
